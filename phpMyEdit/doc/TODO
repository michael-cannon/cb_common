phpMyEdit TODO list
-------------------

So release 5.2 is out. A few new features was planed for this release, the most
important is CSS style policy. They are not implemented now, thus they are not
in 5.2. Release went out, because already fixed bug reports was submitted on
SF.net.

Thus for next 5.3 release is beside another bug fixing also metioned CSS style
policy and DocBook documentation planed as a main priorities.

Stay tuned. 5.3 to come.

-------------------

This was my private list of wanted features with notes of actual bugs in
phpMyEdit. I never suppose, that I will be maintainer of this wonderful
project, so this list of wanted features becomes simple TODO list for
phpMyEdit.

-------------------

* array compatible "sort_field" option to have possibility of default sorting
  according to more than one table column
* fix sorting problem when using table lookup with divs (separator)
* if picture/text links enabled, use texts for filter/search/hide buttons
- create URL links also in record view/delete

- fix this: `filters' option works fine, but when there is column with the same
  name in main table and also in join table, it must be prefixed by table alias
  (TableX.); prefixation with table name of course does not work; maybe note
  should be added into this option to use aliases, because this is difficult to
  fix without CPU expensive SQL parser
- add original variables which will persist whole session support
* reimplement actionStyle to have possibility spefify where you want navigation
  buttons (up, down or both) and/or image/text action links
* implement repeating save in change operation (after repeating save is change
  record displayed again instead of table listing)
  - "Apply" function works fine
- extend patch from Shaun Johnston and add divs['-1'] to implement prefix and
  divs[$n + 1] to implement postfix


* what is difference between default_sort_columns and sort_field
  - not important now, default_sort_columns remove and sort_field brings amount
    of usable features, check doc/ChangeLog file for more information
* after save of records, fields are incorrectly displayed (in example
  Description field in Authors is showed)
  - nasty bug created in 4.x, fixed and works fine
* URLtarget to specify URL target

* links and buttons - booth used for records manipulating is not good
  idea?
  - good idea, implemented, use `navigation' option key for this
* when using images or links instead of buttons, change and delete links
  are constructed with English words (not national):
	http://example.com/authors.php?sfn=0&fl=0&fm=0&operation=Change&rec=1
	http://example.com/authors.php?sfn=0&fl=0&fm=0&operation=Delete&rec=1
  Than it is impossible to change or delete record via links. Other
  functions such as view and copy works well.
  - fixed, works fine

* images should be transparent, and not GIFs but PNGs
+ path prefix specification to graphic image styles
+ default sort columns are cool, but is there a way to specify
  descending ordering? In this case empty strings goes first and
  I want them at the end of list

* value of 0 in number of records to display on the screen will cause
  "Division by zero" error; so this should have the same functionality
  as -1 (display all records)
  - fixed

* according to language uand settings use htmlentities()
  or htmlspecialchars()
  - problematic htmlentities() is not used anymore

+ abbility to take more than one column from external table when using
  optional description field;
  Example:
  I have a table of authors with surname and firstname fields.
  I have also table of articles with author_id field.
  I want during adding new article to select from authors, but not only
  by surname, but by both, surname and firstname.
  Posible solutions:
  1. specify one field '@concat(surname, ', ', firstname)
  2. specify by array
  Although this seems to be difficult to implement.

- ability to resize set of values from external table about value 'not set'
  Example:
  I have table of organizations.
  I have table of users with organization_id field.
  Every user may be in organization, but he/she mustn't.
  So I wanted to select from organization table names or select nothing and
  than organization_id will be 0.

- security hole with View (remove View ability and use operation=View, it will
  also give you a view ability)
- the same with Change (after saving, records will be surprisingly added)



- allow to set CSS's clases for <td> (odd and even), <th>, <table>, <a>, etc
- multiple primary key support
- M:N joins support and similary sets support 
- allow to select any combination of description columns when makes join; eval()
  should be used for this purpose to allow also some simple data transforming
* $inc sets to 0 means unlimited

* implementation of view action - requires change of $labels, but it is
  neccessary
* column ability to be showed and read-only in add/edit screen
  (example of use: description column of property/config table)
- fix page number after search (that means: I'm on page 4/50, I search for
  some records and result is a few in example 5 records, all of these 5 records
  are able to fill 1 page, but I will be after search on page 4/1 - that's
  really strange)
+ fast moving between list pages (pulldown menu with page numbers)
* $where variable in options to specify where clausule for working only
  with subset of data
+ data removing protection - delete will only mark record as deleted
