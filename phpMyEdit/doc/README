phpMyEdit 5.1
-------------

1. Overview

    How many times have you hand coded a MySQL table editor in PHP?
    phpMyEdit application provides an instant table editor.
    
    phpMyEdit generates PHP code for displaying/editing MySQL tables in
    HTML. All you need to do is to write a simple calling program (a
    utility to do this is included). It includes a huge set of table
    manipulation functions (record adition, change, view, copy, and
    remove), table sorting, filtering, table lookups, and more.

2. Installation

    For quick installation follow these steps:

    1. Extract phpMyEdit distribution archive.
    2. Copy/ftp/whatever them to your development web site.
    3. Using a browser, run phpMyEditSetup.php to log on
       to your MySQL server.
    4. Select a database and table.
    5. Script phpMyEditSetup.php will attempt to write two files
       and will display appropriate table handling PHP file.
    6. If the file write to the directory where the files were to be 
       written fails, copy it into your PHP editor, save it to a file, 
       and then run it in the same directory that you used for 
       phpMyEdit.class.php file.

    The generated PHP file is pretty heavily commented. If there's
    anything you don't understand, look on the phpMyEdit web site. You
    can also subscribe into mailinglist and feel free to ask your
    question there.

3. Documentation

    Full documentation for using this program can be found on the
    phpMyEdit web site, http://phpMyEdit.sourceforge.net/4.0b

    This is an old documentation for version 4.0b. New version 5.0 does
    not have currently documentation written. Anyway, although new
    documentation is beeing prepared, it is not neccessary now. Main
    issue of 5.0 release was fixing bugs and not adding new features, so
    you can use old documentation without any problems.

4. Homepage and download

    The official homepage of phpMyEdit project is
    
        http://phpMyEdit.sf.net/

    You can also download the latest version in "Download" section of
    phpMyEdit homepage.

5. Bug reporting

    I'm happy to accept bug reports, suggestions for improvement, or
    improved code, preferably via SourceForge where everyone can see
    them.

    If you're submitting a bug report, please include the main table
    schema (mysqldump -d [database_name] [table_name]), schema for
    supporting ['values']['table'] tables, and the contents of the
    generated PHP file in your bug report. Also be sure to strip out
    database host/user/password info from the generated file.

6. Special usage notes

    If MySQL support is linked into PHP with the header files shipped
    with PHP, PHP will not correctly report all column types. I've only
    had problems with TINYINT and other infrequently used types.
    
7. Mailinglist

    There is phpMyEdit mailinglist provided on SourceForge.Net.
    I recommend you to subscribe if you want to discuss new features
	or participate on further ideas and thoughts.

    You can join this mailinglist by accessing following link

        http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/phpmyedit-discuss

    or by sending e-mail with keyword 'subscribe' in Subject line to
    following e-mail address

        phpmyedit-discuss-request@lists.sourceforge.net

8. CVS access

    Whole phpMyEdit project was imported into Platon SDG
    (http://www.platon.sk/) CVS repository. You can freely checkout
    fresh copy and at least test things, that was broken in your release
    and send particular report to phpMyEdit mailing list. I will
    appreciate it a lot!

    Particular CVS instructions follows. Platon CVS repository can be
    checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS with the following
    instruction set. When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply
    press the Enter key.

    export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@kepler.fmph.uniba.sk:/home/cvs
    cvs login
    cvs checkout phpMyEdit

    These two commands should work with no problems on any UNIX-like
    system with cvs client installed. For checkouting on MS-Windows
    platform you can use one from several free available CVS client
    softwares.
    
9. Developers

    This project was the brain child of John McCreesh who has now moved
    on to other, more pressing projects. Mr. McCreesh had the foresight
    and fortitude to put together an excellent framework. Second project
    maintainer was Jim Kraai who puts a lot of wonderful feature basis
    and continues development in created framework.
    
    Many thanks to the SourceForge crew for providing these facilities
    and to all those who have contributed code. Special thanks to Pau
    Aliagas <pau@newtral.com> who converted phpMyEdit to PHP class in
    version 3.0.

    Current maintainer is Ondrej Jombik with help from various phpMyEdit
    community contributors. See doc/ChangeLog for credits.
