GENERAL:
cb_common abstracts the common module functions out of individual modules.
In doing this, I've created a module commonality area. Use phpMyEdit to create 
forms and their database handling near automatically. Review the template module
for examples.

Upon updates and installs, cb_common is designed to overwrite itself everytime.
That way previous release errors are minimized. If you customize cb_common
though, then you'll lose your edits so be sure to backup those changes. Even
better submit them to cbcvs@peimic.com for potential inclusion into the library.

Generally, Cannon BOSE module options are stored in a database. The tool used
for simplifying those operations is called phpMyEdit. Some features need
explanation of that tool:
Add - insert a new data row
More - insert a new data row and return to the Add screen
Change - modify a data row
View - display a data row's contents
Prev/Next - data row navigation buttons. They are disabled if not used for a
particular data view.


WARNING:
Please don't delete the cb_common directory or else Cannon BOSE modules will fail to work.


REGARDS:
Thank you for using a Cannon BOSE module. Please send questions, comments, and
concerns to cbcvs@peimic.com.
